The man heard the noise and suddenly turned to look at me, his eyes fixated on my hand. Terrified, I frantically pressed the button to close the elevator doors. Just as the doors were about to close, a bloodied hand reached in. I knew then that I would never be able to go to school again.

After A and B fell asleep, the fake C removed the fake door, exited through the real door, and brought in the real C, who was unconscious, and killed him with a brick.
